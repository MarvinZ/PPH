<p>Jazz Affiliates will pay the affiliate a commission based on the players’ net losses. These players must have signed up through
  your Affiliate website or tracking ID. It is required for the referred player to make a real money deposit in order for
  the Affiliate to receive commissions over his/her net losses. Net revenue is calculated as all gross monies from wagers
  in Sports book, Casino, Live Wagering, live Dealer, and Race book minus the corresponding transaction, bonus, and processing
  fees. Fees charged by certain third parties/providers (Live Dealer and Casino suppliers) will be applied at the end of
  each month to the affiliate’s account. Affiliates commission will be calculated on a monthly basis with losses carried
  over to the following month (make up)

<p>
  Your affiliate account must have a minimum of 3 active customers during the month to be eligible for a Commission payment.
  If you desire to offer extra incentives to potential referred players, you are required to receive our written approval;
  otherwise, commissions generated by such unauthorized incentive will be void. In case fraudulent activity is detected by
  the referred player or the Affiliate, we reserve the right to terminate this agreement and hold any commission generated
  through fraud at our own discretion. Please feel free to contact us at info@jazzaffiliates.com if you have any additional
  questions or banner requirements.
